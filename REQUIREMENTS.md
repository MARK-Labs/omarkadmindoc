# Manage Funder's Reporting Requirements

Your Funder may require additional reporting requirements. These templates will be similar to the Templates that you would have created for your own reporting requirements. Instead of having to submit the data twice, you can map the data from an existing template. This will automatically transfer the data over.

## Accessing the page.

In order to determine if you have any requirements, select "Funders" from Settings Menu. Beside each funder, if you have any requirements, you will be able to see them.

## Mapping a template

To map the requirements of the template, click on the template name. You you will be provided a screen to select from one of your own templates. Once you have selected the template, you can then select how each field from the required template maps to the field from your template. For any fields which are Multiple Choice, Drop Down or Checkbox, you will be also required to map the individual options.
