# User Management

Impact&trade allows you to give access to other users in your organisation.

## Accessing the page

To access this page, select "Users" from the "Settings" menu.

## Inviting a user

To invite a user, enter their email click "Send Invitation". This will send them an email to invite them to use Impact&trade as a user (They will not have administrative privileges). They will be provided instructions for completing their registration.

## Pending Invitations

Once a user has been invited, they will appear under Pending Invitations. To cancel the invitation click on the ![cross icon](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Delete Icon"). If this is done prior to them completing their registration, they will not be able to register. To resend the invitation, click on the ![recycle icon](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Resend Icon").

## Confirmed Invitations

Once the user has confirmed their invitation, they will appear under the Confirmed Invitations list. You can disable their account by clicking on the ![disable icon](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Disable Icon"). They will not be able to access this company account the next time they log in. Once disabled, a "(Disabled)" tag will appear beside their name.
