# Configure Reporting Requirements

Impact&trade; allows you to define reporting requirements about the type of impact you would like to communicate. In order to this you must first define the Programmes you have. Next, you will define the Activities that you do in order to achieve the goals of the Programme. Then, you will define the Template to describe how you will capture the necessary  data to communicate your Impact. Finally you will create KPIs to track the performance of your work.

## Accessing the page

To access this page, select "Activities" from the "Settings" menu. On this page, you will be able to create Templates and KPIs.

## Programmes

A programme is usually tied to a specific outcome area (i.e. Education). To create a programme, click "New Programme" at the top of the page. Each programme will appear in a drop down menu. You can switch between them. To edit the currently selected programme, click "Edit Programme".

## Activities

Activities are created to describe general pieces of work that are happening to achieve the goals of the programme. You can create one or more activities. To create an activity, click "New Activity" under the Programme drop down. You can switch between the activities. To edit the currently selected activity, click "Edit Activity".


## Templates

Templates define the type of data you would like to collect. They will contain a name to describe the template and a number of fields each with a specific type. Although not shown when creating a template, when users submit data for a template, they will be asked for the location and time of the record. The platform currently supports the following data types.

##### Short Answer
A text input used to collect fields that are less than 50 characters. This is useful for capturing short fields like names of people, places and things.

##### Paragraph
A text input to capture larger amount of text input. This is useful for capturing longer descriptive responses.

#####  Number
A text input to capture numbers. This is currently the only field type that can be tracked in an KPI.

##### Date
An input where the user will be able to select from a Calendar. You do not need to ask when this event has happened because it is automatically asked as a field.

##### Multiple Choice
An input where the user will have radio buttons. They will be able to make one choice (You must specify at least option). This is useful for showing all the options and requesting the user to choose one.

##### Check Box
An input where the user will have checkboxes. They will able to select more than one option. You must specify at least option. There will be ![plus icon](https://d3e1wbkfmk6n2w.cloudfront.net/fa/plus.png "Plus Icon") for you to add at least one option.

##### Drop Down

## KPIs

After creating a template, you can define a KPI to track the data collected from your template.

##### Describing the KPI

You can provide a name and description for the KPI. This will give context to the KPI for the users on your platform.

##### Configuring how the KPI will run.

You can enable/disable the KPI by choosing the appropriate value from the Status Drop Down. While the KPI is Inactive, no data will be collected against the KPI and it will not appear on the Impact&trade; dashboard. You can also specify when you would like to start (Reporting From) collecting the data and how often (Reporting Period).

##### Configuring how the KPI will be calculated.

You will be able to select the template from which the data will come from. Once selected, you can select the type of calculation you want to make

* **Count** - Simply count the number of entries that have been made for this template
* **Sum** - Sum a number field within the template over the reporting period
* **Average** - Take the average of the values of a number field within the template over the reporting period.
* **Ratio** - Take a ratio of two number fields within the template over the reporting period.

For The last three types are only applicable for number fields. Once selected, you can enter the expected projected value you would like the KPI to be measured against.
